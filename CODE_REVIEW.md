## Code Review: `setWaitingInterval.ts`

### What the Code Does

This file creates a custom version of `setInterval` using `setTimeout`.  
It lets you pass in an array of delays so the time between function calls can change.  
It also makes sure the function doesn’t run again until the previous run is finished, which helps avoid overlapping calls.

---

### What’s Good

- The main function is documented and explains what it does.
- Functions are separated and organized well, which makes the code easier to read and maintain.
- Using a Map to keep track of interval IDs is a smart way to manage multiple intervals. This approach allows for easy lookup and cancellation of specific intervals, which is more scalable than relying on global variables.
- There’s some error checking for types in the delay array, which helps prevent certain runtime bugs.
- The idea of using an array of timeouts to gradually increase the delay is flexible and could be useful for backoff strategies (like retrying failed network requests).

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Changing the Array**
   - The helper function `getLastUntilOneLeft` uses `.pop()` on the `timeouts` array. This changes the array that was passed in, which could cause problems if someone wants to reuse it.
   - It would be better to make a copy of the array before changing it. This is important because in JavaScript, arrays are passed by reference, so any mutation affects the original array outside the function as well.

2. **Handler Arguments**
   - The handler is called as `handler(argsInternal)`, which passes an array as a single argument. If the handler expects separate arguments, this might not work.
   - Using `handler(...argsInternal)` would fix this. Spreading the arguments makes the function more flexible and allows it to support handlers with multiple parameters.

3. **Empty Timeouts Array**
   - If the `timeouts` array is empty, the code will try to use `undefined` as the delay, which could cause errors.
   - Adding a check for an empty array would help. For example, throwing an error or setting a default delay would make the function safer and prevent hard-to-find bugs.

4. **Naming**
   - The variable `map` could be renamed to `intervalMap` to make it clearer. This helps anyone reading the code quickly understand what the map is storing.
   - The variable `waitingIntervalId` could be named `nextIntervalId` to show it’s for generating new IDs. Clear naming reduces confusion and improves maintainability, especially in team environments.

5. **Types**
   - The handler is typed as `Function`, which is pretty broad. Using something like `(...args: any[]) => void` would be more specific. This improves type safety and helps with code completion and error checking in editors.

6. **Error Messages**
   - The error messages could be more descriptive to help with debugging. For example, including the actual value that caused the error can make it easier to track down issues.

### Edge Cases

It would be good to check how the code behaves if the timeouts array is very large, contains non-number values, or if unexpected arguments are passed in.  
Testing these scenarios ensures the function is robust and behaves predictably, even with unusual or incorrect input.

---

### Performance

This approach should be efficient for most uses, but could be slower if the timeouts array is very large.  
In practice, most use cases will have a small array, but it’s good to be aware that repeated `.pop()` operations and large arrays could impact performance if used in a high-frequency context.

---

### Real-World Use

This kind of custom interval could be useful for things like retrying network requests, creating animations, or controlling game loops.  
It’s especially helpful in cases where you want to implement exponential backoff or avoid overlapping function executions, which is common in frontend applications and APIs.

---

### Testing

Adding some unit tests for this function would help catch bugs and make it easier to change or improve the code in the future.  
Tests could cover empty arrays, invalid types, and making sure intervals clear correctly.  
Testing also gives confidence that future changes won’t break existing functionality and helps document the intended behavior for other developers.

---

### Teamwork

Better comments and clearer variable names would help other developers understand and work with this code more easily, especially in a team setting.  
Good documentation and naming conventions are essential for effective collaboration, onboarding new team members, and maintaining code quality over time.

---

### Overall Thoughts

The code works well and is organized, but with a few small changes it would be safer and easier for other people to use.  
I understand how it works and could explain each part if asked.  
Addressing the points above would make the utility more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly for both solo and team projects.
