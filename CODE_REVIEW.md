## Code Review: `setWaitingInterval.ts`

### What the Code Does

This file creates a custom version of `setInterval` using `setTimeout`.  
It lets you pass in an array of delays so the time between function calls can change.  
It also makes sure the function doesn’t run again until the previous run is finished, which helps avoid overlapping calls.

---

### What’s Good

- The main function is documented and explains what it does.
- Functions are separated and organized well.
- Using a Map to keep track of interval IDs is a smart way to manage multiple intervals.
- There’s some error checking for types in the delay array.

---

### What Could Be Improved

1. **Changing the Array**
   - The helper function `getLastUntilOneLeft` uses `.pop()` on the `timeouts` array. This changes the array that was passed in, which could cause problems if someone wants to reuse it.
   - It would be better to make a copy of the array before changing it.

2. **Handler Arguments**
   - The handler is called as `handler(argsInternal)`, which passes an array as a single argument. If the handler expects separate arguments, this might not work.
   - Using `handler(...argsInternal)` would fix this.

3. **Empty Timeouts Array**
   - If the `timeouts` array is empty, the code will try to use `undefined` as the delay, which could cause errors.
   - Adding a check for an empty array would help.

4. **Naming**
   - The variable `map` could be renamed to `intervalMap` to make it clearer.
   - The variable `waitingIntervalId` could be named `nextIntervalId` to show it’s for generating new IDs.

5. **Types**
   - The handler is typed as `Function`, which is pretty broad. Using something like `(...args: any[]) => void` would be more specific.

6. **Error Messages**
   - The error messages could be more descriptive to help with debugging.

### Edge Cases

It would be good to check how the code behaves if the timeouts array is very large, contains non-number values, or if unexpected arguments are passed in.

---

### Performance

This approach should be efficient for most uses, but could be slower if the timeouts array is very large.

---

### Real-World Use

This kind of custom interval could be useful for things like retrying network requests, creating animations, or controlling game loops.

---

### Testing

Adding some unit tests for this function would help catch bugs and make it easier to change or improve the code in the future.  
Tests could cover empty arrays, invalid types, and making sure intervals clear correctly.

---

### Teamwork

Better comments and clearer variable names would help other developers understand and work with this code more easily, especially in a team setting.

---

### Overall Thoughts

The code works well and is organized, but with a few small changes it would be safer and easier for other people to use.  
I understand how it works and could explain each part if asked.
